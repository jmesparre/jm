## Current Work Focus

Initializing the memory bank documentation based on the provided project context and file structure.

## Recent Changes

- Created the `memory-bank` directory.
- Created initial markdown files for `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
- Populated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` with information provided by the user.
- Populated `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` by analyzing the `package.json` file and the project structure.

## Next Steps

- Populate `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Review all memory bank files for completeness and accuracy.
- Await further instructions on the next development task.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Assuming the project structure and `package.json` accurately reflect the current technical setup.
- The project appears to be a Next.js application using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Use of Next.js App Router (`app` directory).
- Component organization within `components/ui` and `components/blocks`.
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is a modern React/Next.js application with a clear component structure and styling approach.
- The presence of `components.json` strongly suggests the use of shadcn/ui.
