# Active Context

This document captures the current focus of work, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, learnings, and project insights.

## Current Work Focus

Updating the memory bank documentation to reflect the expanded project scope, objectives, structure, and implementation plan provided by the user.

## Recent Changes

- Created the `memory-bank` directory and initial core files.
- Populated initial memory bank files based on the project structure and `package.json`.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` with the new project objectives, structure, and implementation steps.
- Updated `productContext.md` with the expanded purpose, problems solved, how it works, and user experience goals.
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` to include backend and headless CMS integration in the architecture overview and key technical decisions.
- Updated `techContext.md` to include potential new technologies for backend and headless CMS, and updated development setup and tool usage patterns accordingly.

## Next Steps

- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the expanded scope and remaining tasks.
- Review all memory bank files for completeness and accuracy based on the new requirements.
- Begin implementing the first steps of the plan: Wireframes & Contenido (although wireframing and content writing are typically manual steps, I can prepare the project structure for this).
- Await further instructions on proceeding with the implementation steps, starting with setting up the necessary pages and components based on the site map.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The project scope has significantly expanded to include a blog, detailed service pages, backend integration for contact forms, and a headless CMS.
- Decisions are pending on the specific backend technology (Supabase vs Netlify Functions) and headless CMS (Sanity vs Strapi). These decisions will impact subsequent implementation steps.
- The implementation plan provides a clear roadmap, starting with wireframing and content, then design, frontend development, backend/CMS integration, SEO, deployment, and monitoring.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Use of Next.js App Router (`app` directory).
- Component organization within `components/ui` and `components/blocks`.
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS.
- Use of shadcn/ui components.
- Integration with external backend and CMS services.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is evolving from a basic portfolio to a more comprehensive business website with lead generation and content marketing capabilities.
- The choice of backend and CMS will be critical for the project's maintainability and scalability.
- The provided implementation plan offers a structured approach to tackling the expanded scope.
