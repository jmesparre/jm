# Progress

This document tracks what has been built, what remains, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- The basic project structure is in place, including Next.js configuration, essential dependencies (React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript), and initial directories for components and pages.
- The memory bank directory and core documentation files have been created and partially populated.

## What's Left to Build

- The core content of the portfolio website (Homepage, Portfolio section, About section, Contact information/form) needs to be developed.
- Implementation of specific UI components using shadcn/ui and other libraries.
- Styling and responsiveness across different devices.
- SEO optimization based on the goal of achieving the best possible search engine positioning.
- Integration of animations using the `motion` library.
- Populating the portfolio section with actual project details.

## Current Status

The project is in the initial setup and documentation phase. The foundational structure and technical context have been established, and the memory bank is being populated to guide future development.

## Known Issues

- The content of the core website sections is not yet implemented.
- Specific design details and content for the portfolio items are pending.

## Evolution of Decisions

- The decision to use Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS appears to be the current direction based on the existing `package.json` and file structure.
- The use of shadcn/ui components is implied and will likely be a key part of the UI development process.
