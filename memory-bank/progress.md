# Progress

This document tracks what has been built, what remains, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- The basic project structure is in place, including Next.js configuration, essential dependencies (React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript), and initial directories for components and pages.
- The memory bank directory and core documentation files have been created and updated to reflect the expanded project scope and plan.
- **Scroll-based page navigation in `PageWrapper.tsx` is now functional**, allowing navigation between pages by scrolling to the top/bottom of the content.
- The **hydration mismatch error related to `PageWrapper.tsx` has been resolved** by refactoring the component's structure and class application.
- **New service pages have been created**: `/servicios/desarrollo-web` and `/servicios/servicios-de-diseno`.
- **Links to new service pages are integrated**:
    - In `app/servicios/page.tsx`.
    - In `components/blocks/animated-slideshow-demo.tsx` for "slide-1" (Desarrollo Web) and "slide-2" (Servicios de Diseño).
- **URL issue with special characters (`ñ`) has been resolved**: The directory `servicios-de-diseño` was renamed to `servicios-de-diseno`, and all relevant links were updated.
- **"Sobre Mí" section has been added**: `/sobre-mi` page and `app/sobre-mi/page.tsx` created.
- **Blog section has been added**: `/blog` page and `app/blog/page.tsx` created.
- **Blog component integrated**: `Blog8` component (`components/blocks/blog8.tsx`) and its demo (`components/blocks/blog8-demo.tsx`) have been added.
- **ShadCN `Card` component installed**: `components/ui/card.tsx` has been added.
- **`lucide-react` dependency installed**.
- **`Blog8Demo` component integrated into `app/proyectos/page.tsx`**.
- **`memory-bank/ShadCN-context.md` updated** to include `Card`.
- **All `page.tsx` files in `app/` directory have been reviewed.** The content is primarily informative and utilizes existing components, with no significant structural changes or new functionalities requiring deep updates beyond what is already documented.
- **Scroll-based page navigation on mobile now correctly navigates on scroll down.**
- **A 1-second debounce/timer has been implemented for scroll-based page navigation** to prevent rapid page skipping.
- **Scroll boundary detection has been made more forgiving** in `PageWrapper.tsx` to improve mobile navigation.
- **Contact form frontend (`components/ui/contact-2.tsx`) has been updated** to handle form state, submission, and display feedback.
- **Brevo API key and contact email have been added to `.env.local`**.
- **`@getbrevo/brevo` package has been installed**.
- **Brevo email sending functionality in `app/api/contact/route.ts` has been updated to use a direct `fetch` request to the Brevo API**, resolving previous TypeScript errors with the SDK.
- **The `app/api/contact/route.ts` has been updated to use a fixed, verified sender email (`jmesparre@gmail.com`)** and include the user's submitted email in the message body, resolving the "sender not valid" error from Brevo.
- **Implemented a sequential, context-aware image preloading system** to enhance perceived navigation speed. The logic is centralized in `PageWrapper.tsx` and preloads the main image for the next page in the navigation sequence after the current page has fully loaded.
- **Added a loading indicator** that appears in the bottom-right corner during scroll-based page transitions, improving user feedback during navigation.

## What's Left to Build

Based on the implementation steps outlined in the Project Brief:

1.  **Wireframes & Contenido**:
    -   Bocetar distribución de cada página.
    -   Redactar textos SEO friendly (investigar palabras clave relevantes).
2.  **Diseño Visual**:
    -   Definir paleta de colores y tipografía alineada a tu branding.
    -   Crear prototipos interactivos
3.  **Desarrollo Front‑end**:
    -   Configurar Next.js routes and page templates for all remaining sections (Home, About, Contact).
    -   Implement reusable components (Header, Footer, CTA, etc.).
    -   Develop Contact page with form and scheduling integration.
    -   Implement responsive design for all new content.
4.  **Back‑end (if applicable)**:
    -   Integrate contact form with a backend endpoint (Supabase or Netlify Functions).
    -   Configure headless CMS (Sanity or Strapi) for the blog.
5.  **SEO & Performance**:
    -   Add metatags, sitemap.xml and robots.txt.
    -   Optimize images and lazy‑loading.
    -   Conduct Lighthouse tests and improve scores.
6.  **Despliegue**:
    -   Configure domains and SSL certificates.
7.  **Monitoreo y Actualizaciones**:
    -   Install Google Analytics / Hotjar.
    -   Establish process for periodic updates to the blog and portfolio.

## Current Status

The project is actively under development. Significant progress has been made on setting up the core structure, adding new service and blog pages, and integrating new components. All `page.tsx` files have been reviewed. The memory bank has been thoroughly updated to reflect these changes. The mobile scroll navigation issue has been addressed with multiple refinements. The contact form frontend is ready, and the backend API route for Brevo has been successfully implemented using a direct `fetch` request, with the sender validation issue now resolved.

## Known Issues

- The content for all website sections (including services, portfolio items, and blog posts) is still placeholder and needs to be created.
- Specific design details and visual prototypes are pending.
- The choice of backend technology for the contact form and the headless CMS for the blog are pending decisions.
- **Production Issue (Resolved):** The Brevo API key was not configured in the Vercel production environment, but this has been addressed by guiding the user to configure it directly in Vercel's project settings.
- **Email Delivery Issue (Resolved):** Emails were not being received due to an unverified sender email (`artesanluis8@gmail.com`). This has been resolved by modifying the API route to use a fixed, verified sender (`jmesparre@gmail.com`) and including the user's email in the message body.

## Evolution of Decisions

- The project scope has significantly expanded to include a blog, detailed service pages, backend integration, and a headless CMS, moving beyond a basic portfolio site.
- The implementation plan provides a structured approach to address the increased complexity.
- Key technical decisions regarding backend and CMS are yet to be finalized.
- The scroll-based navigation was initially implemented with a threshold, then refined to trigger at the absolute top/bottom of content, and now includes a debounce to improve user experience and correct navigation direction, along with more forgiving scroll boundary detection.
- The issue with special characters in URLs was identified and resolved by standardizing directory and link names to ASCII-compatible versions.
- The contact form email sending functionality is now implemented using a direct `fetch` request to the Brevo API, resolving previous issues with the `@getbrevo/brevo` SDK.
- Identified and documented the need to configure environment variables directly in Vercel for production deployments.
- Diagnosed and resolved the Brevo sender validation issue by changing the API route to use a fixed, verified sender email.
