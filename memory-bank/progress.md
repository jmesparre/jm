# Progress

This document tracks what has been built, what remains, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- The basic project structure is in place, including Next.js configuration, essential dependencies (React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript), and initial directories for components and pages.
- The memory bank directory and core documentation files have been created and updated to reflect the expanded project scope and plan.
- **Scroll-based page navigation in `PageWrapper.tsx` is now functional**, allowing navigation between pages by scrolling to the top/bottom of the content.
- The **hydration mismatch error related to `PageWrapper.tsx` has been resolved** by refactoring the component's structure and class application.

## What's Left to Build

Based on the implementation steps outlined in the Project Brief:

1.  **Wireframes & Contenido**:
    -   Bocetar distribución de cada página.
    -   Redactar textos SEO friendly (investigar palabras clave relevantes).
2.  **Diseño Visual**:
    -   Definir paleta de colores y tipografía alineada a tu branding.
    -   Crear prototipos interactivos
3.  **Desarrollo Front‑end**:
    -   Configurar Next.js routes and page templates for all sections (Home, Services, Portfolio, About, Blog, Contact).
    -   Implementar reusable components (Header, Footer, CTA, Cards, etc.).
    -   Develop individual service pages.
    -   Develop Portfolio/Case Studies section.
    -   Develop About Me/Us section.
    -   Develop Blog/Resources section.
    -   Develop Contact page with form and scheduling integration.
    -   Implement responsive design.
    -   **Implement a 1-second debounce/timer for scroll-based page navigation** to prevent rapid page skipping.
4.  **Back‑end (if applicable)**:
    -   Integrate contact form with a backend endpoint (Supabase or Netlify Functions).
    -   Configure headless CMS (Sanity or Strapi) for the blog.
5.  **SEO & Performance**:
    -   Add metatags, sitemap.xml and robots.txt.
    -   Optimize images and lazy‑loading.
    -   Conduct Lighthouse tests and improve scores.
6.  **Despliegue**:
    -   Configure domains and SSL certificates.
7.  **Monitoreo y Actualizaciones**:
    -   Install Google Analytics / Hotjar.
    -   Establish process for periodic updates to the blog and portfolio.

## Current Status

The project is in the development phase. The foundational structure and technical context have been established, and the memory bank has been updated. Scroll-based page navigation has been implemented and is functional, but requires further refinement for user experience.

## Known Issues

- The content for all website sections (including services, portfolio items, and blog posts) is not yet created.
- Specific design details and visual prototypes are pending.
- The choice of backend technology for the contact form and the headless CMS for the blog are pending decisions.
- **Scroll-based page navigation is too sensitive**, leading to rapid page skipping when scrolling quickly. A debounce/timer is needed.

## Evolution of Decisions

- The project scope has significantly expanded to include a blog, detailed service pages, backend integration, and a headless CMS, moving beyond a basic portfolio site.
- The implementation plan provides a structured approach to address the increased complexity.
- Key technical decisions regarding backend and CMS are yet to be finalized.
- The scroll-based navigation was initially implemented with a threshold, then refined to trigger at the absolute top/bottom of content, and now requires a debounce to improve user experience.
