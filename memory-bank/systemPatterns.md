# System Patterns

This document outlines the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modern web application architecture based on Next.js, which supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). This allows for performance optimizations like faster initial page loads and improved SEO. The frontend is built with React, utilizing a component-based structure.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Framework:** Next.js was chosen for its flexibility in rendering (SSR/SSG), built-in routing, API routes, and overall developer experience with React.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development and consistent design.
- **Component Library:** Radix UI is likely used for building accessible and unstyled components, which are then styled with Tailwind CSS (as suggested by the presence of `@radix-ui/react-slot` and `class-variance-authority`).
- **Animation:** The `motion` library is included for handling animations, suggesting a focus on dynamic and engaging UI elements.

## Design Patterns

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The project is structured around reusable React components (e.g., components/ui, components/blocks).
- **Utility-First CSS:** Leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling promotes a utility-first approach.

## Component Relationships

- UI components (like Button, Card, Carousel from `components/ui`) serve as building blocks.
- Block components (like `gallery4.tsx`, `demo.tsx` in `components/blocks`) compose UI components and other elements to form larger sections of the page.
- Pages (`app/page.tsx`) assemble blocks and other components to create the final user interface.

## Critical Implementation Paths

- **Page Rendering:** How Next.js handles routing and renders pages (SSR/SSG).
- **Component Composition:** How UI and block components are combined to build pages.
- **Styling Application:** How Tailwind CSS utilities and potentially custom CSS are applied to components.
